# A parallel story of two and two Jazz Musicians from Paris

It is actually Hamza, Damien and Julien. {{The author}} met the partner of Damine only briefly and forgot his name, yet their stories was of constant interest and there was earlier unfullfilled arrangements to make music together that failed due to the same trance {{the author}} is talking about in this entire book. {{He|She|It}}
met after another Trans-Europe train trip Berlin-Paris-London. The first night in Paris is like a time travel to the intelligencia of the early 20th century. Philosophers, artisans, scientists sit and perform entertaining tasks at a friends luxury appartment. After billions of wine, {{the author}} had a romantic one night stand with an elderly chemist researcher from Italy. Leaving a fake number, and heading for a dinner with {{his|her|its}} friends {{he]she|it}} starts drinking again and just barely makes it to the train to London from Gare du l'est. On the train {{the author}} calls Steve, an Australian singer-song-writer, who will the following year give up on his dream to become a British singing legend. Supposingly an option in guitar music. Steve is really happy to hear {{the author}} made the journey and invites {{him|her|it}} to a concert he had coming up the very same night. What a lucky surprise. 

{{The author}} thinks to {{himself|herself|itself}}: "Nice, a cozy English pub some beers and friends. What a great conincidence." Yet, {{he]she|it}} was totally wrong. {{The author}} shrugs as he hears the venue name-Fabrics? That doesn't sound like a poet's stage? It is London's most famous techno warehouse-asking for abrief explaination for this off-focus locality, this is French band is mentioned. Just, as {{the author}} recalls this event, the S-Bahn is passing "Salon zur Wilden Renate", the residence club of the French macs. 

Getting to the club is easy. {{The author}} has an MPC 1000 and a TR-707 in alluminum cases, so also getting in is super easy after he mentioned the friends name. A regular, but not so easy to perform stunt, that due to the weight of the gear and the actual value that if the party is getting too wild, may risk further performance ability. {{He|She|It}} finds Steve in a super good mood and is draged backstage. The club is amazing, 3 floors, more than 1000 people and dark industrial techno and house from everywhere. Loads of drunk English boys and girls. It doesn't take long till the first lines of coke are thrown onto the table. {{The author}} actually has never seen this much spread out on a table ever before. It feels like the band and crew is using their lower arms to make lines. Surprisingly enough, some conversation is possible and Damien tells about his passion and Jazz education. {{The author}} does not know yet, he was actually studying together with Hamza and Julien in Paris, that {{he|she|it}} is going to meet more than one year later for the first time in Austria on a mountain cottage.

Damien and Steve are very fine people and {{the author}} wonders what is wrong at this place? Why are they here? Later on, the show embarks, Steve actually brought an electric guitar and Damien is playing a crazy Moog synthezier, rocking the house fueled with Champaign by their manager, a sleezy bold headed guy with tiny glasses from behind the stage. {{The author}} steals one or the other bottle of champaign  and jumps the stage 
{{himself|herself|itself}} every once in a while. A raging techno house party!

It's two years later, Hamza (saxophone) and Julien (trumpet) decided to travel to Berlin after they encounter {{the author}} in Steiermark close to Graz on the mountain camp. They spend a few days recording with Damien, but as {{the author}} has told them before, their mental and musical capabilities shrank down to a minimun that barely empowered his and his friend to play and record arranged songs. No improvisation, no sense. Long story short, they were pissed and hoped to find salvation in jaming with {{the author}}. Julien buys a bottle of Vodka every night and later after their departure {{the author}} has no other use for it but to make mouthwash with Blutwurz, Süßholz and Kamille.

None of these recordings ever made it to the public, yet the guys played a show with {{the author}} at OHM formerly Shift at Tresor. A place initially designed by Tresor to regain street credibility and opened on new years 2013. It was first curated by Leon, a very smart young and ambitious curator. His deals were easy, artists were allowed to propose whatever or where contacted by Leon directly to showcase between exhibition performance, and of course culminate if the given crowd allowed into a party. Within a year, the bar boss Thorsten, a very nice fellow as well, yet much longer in the business was pushing towards a more profitable booking. He pressed limits such as filling the space before a certain time, make a minimun of at least 400,00 EUR at the bar

Some techno math: 

Shift/OHM is a venue of 70 people maximum capacity at the same time. Over a night the most {{the author}} ever heard of was 150/170 souls, and that is packed.

"Underground" promoters are an enthusiastic bunch that can charge not much more than 5,00 EUR at the door for a night. Reasons therefore are an audience consisting mostly of hipsters, students and self-chosen starving artists, who see no much value is redistributing to "their own kind". Hedonists enjoy free beer more than anything!

So a promoter can make 200,00-350,00 EUR a night that lasts from 10 PM - 6 AM. That's 8 hours of DJ and if the promoter is ready to take any sort of risk, there may be a 50 minute to 1h 30 minutes. So that's an average of 4 DJ's plus 1 or 2 musicians. 

That makes an average of not even 50,00 EUR each act, the promoter taking none. 

The bar consists of 3 people selling small beers for 3,00 EUR (buying: 0,50 EUR) and long drinks for 6,00 to 8,00 EUR. The drinking ability of ravers is increased with the amount of drugs taken. 20,00 are minimum to enjoy 6 hours of rave. One can easily add another 30,00 EUR on various addeables. So on a good night the bar makes a profit of 1000,00 to 2000,00 EURs profit, paying 3 people 10 EUR for 8 hours - that's 240,00 EUR personal. Now the mininum of 400,00 makes sense. Even on a bad night, where the promoters make not much more than 100,00 EUR at the door, and the acts have an empty dancefloor (or idealistically a place for performances) working at the bar is never about music! The deal is not even and the motivation is truely driven by other measures.

{{The author}} does not recognize Laptops as a convincing tool for live performance. It is more like reading some friends facebookstream or realtime downloading samples from beatport. An introverted journey into a digital parallel existence, that is cut off the audience present. The state of mind in which a creative process is meeting an audience require physical connection between intend and immidiate Nachvollziehbarkeit and creates a collaborative enthusiasm about the thing produced. In {{the author's}} opinion a DJ has more a social and curational purpose and rarely ellaborates his skills or function to that of a performer. Marketing is often blurring the image and trys to indentify artistic creation with the persona of a DJ. Entertainer smile at the audience and provoke their reaction with gestures, cliches, jokes and a very huge stock of popular references. They present what various others created in a cheerful and well-curated manner. Entertainers are ABOUT what they are showcasing. Performers are communicating through what they produce. A live performance is the most intimite moment for a musician. Only if our general communication is shifting to a new level of recognition and realization through our very own center of perception, we are able to make a difference between the both.
