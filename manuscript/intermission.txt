# Intermission

It is time to draw a resumee. {{The author}} tries  to see clearly for a moment to harvest the fruits of the trip if there is any. In an older thought {{the author}} questioned {{his|her|its}} constant challenge

to explore,
by failing,
and restart,
retreat,
reintegrate,
life in the world of ratio, living in delieria,
the hardship of the interim between two worlds, 
that of mostly social dualism.

What can be a resume of loosing the head, what does a monk bring back from the holy mountain, 
and did not for the quest after the holy grail, explore that gold creations alchemy is good for table wear?
Whenever there is poetry, whenever there is sound, there is matter. (just a few days ago at CERN they found out the basis of all matter is resonance)

How can {{the author}} bring back {{his|her|its}} discovery is yet another question, and only art will leave the most common techniques unregarded. {{The author}} is not lost when he is tripping, ending the trip will lose its focus, therefore a simple very rational return to common sense  and a story that even non global jetters, non ravers and truely untouched by psychodelics pioneers can comprehend and model future learning in cross.

The dualist relation of city and land,
the rural and the urban has various
entry points for trippers.
It has always been an in and out ever 
since the market places manifested and 
became centers of exchange.
Of wise or not so wise travellers passing.
In the cities they often have been looking for something,
for followers to join their evangelion,
for plenty {{girls|boys|machines}}
with beautiful {{mothers|fathers|creators}} and rich "Aussteuer"
for engagement. {{The author}} was a wandering 
{{craftsman|craftswoman|crafter}} back in the days
of the 2nd crusade sent out by {{his|her|its}} {{father|mother|creator}} being the 3rd
{{son|daughter|offspring}} of their cottage 
and nothing was to inherit whatsoever.

{{He|She|It}} was passing many cities, 
and seeing many lands,
