# Morning, grey, techno is on the way.

The author and two friends that camp in his appartment drag their bodies to his studio. As usual they miss the S-Bahn connecting to the Ring at NeukÃ¶lln. 

It is 12:30 and {{the author}} wonders what might be the reason for which {{he]she|it}} is hanging out with these dudes. They have been his only connection to a vaguely self-defnied philosophy of understanding everything and the core of any situation. Their research is mostly trance induced paired with a little something for insomnia, another something waking and staying up, yet another against a depression that probably arose some time during the last regular job, and a bunch of others things for general exploration.

It is 12:45. Still {{he]she|it}} is wondering what makes them so self-assured. In a way there is probably 200000 souls like them in this city that have the same experience, but why in god's name did they choose to to stay with {{him|her|it}}? They continue preaching free choice, yet all choose the same something.

> "What role am I playing right now?"

{{The author}} stops his daily routine at this very moment, goes deep inside hiimself and is analyzing what {{he]she|it}} is - where {{he]she|it}} is.

"I am not a subject. I is the role I am playing at any given point in time, so I is {{the author}}.
I am sitting at a Jobcenter, trying to find help to get out of programming. If this fails, I, {{the author}} will have to go to a monastray, temple or farm, start a hermittage. Abandon the city, that could not keep up with my expectations. I am a hipster, overqualified, overdressed. {{The author}} feels some uncomfort in a place he has never been before. I am a patient who is going to get help by a company/institute for utilizing human resource, yet it feels like comforting help at least for right now. {{The author}} gains comfort in simply waiting for instructions. Years of self-reliant freelance and not actual but contemplated independence have worn {{him|her|it}} tired of making decissions. {{The author}} feels like a loser, yet the people waiting along side with him share no such projections. {{The author}} relaxes .. and again tonight I has to play another role. Techno live set at Tresor. With a double Zen circle in its logo, what could one possibly expect?"

{{The author}} waits another 15 minutes gazing at those immigrants, socially disabled and kicked out of society creatures around, takes {{his|her|its}} waiting ticket, kicks it in the trash bin and head's out of this god forsaken human dump ...
