### Tütte mit System (zum Aufreisen), Systeme ohne Tütte.

In what Dimension is a systematic approach helpful to identify the needs of customers or clients or the new model of social entity. Since we already merged producers and clients as we melted them together by the rules of the merchantile system and other social bounds, the question is one of consistency of a system, integrity.

"Paperbag with system" is meant to promote the cleverness of the provider, the bakery in that case, and uses a by the provider already favoured bag made out of paper to convince of a good eating experience. Yet, all it does is shifting the lead of attention to marketing instead of the product which is after all just a bloody sandwich from a bakery. {{The author}} thinks there is an inequality in "layering of systems". That of the organic fair trade sonscious citizen who prefers paper towards plastic, order ("mit System") over disorder, yet he unconsciously oversees even then ban was wrapt with a second layer of waxed paper. 

{{The author}} compares this "Al Natura" approach to traditional alternatives, where a sandwich is taken out of the display and put on a plate next to a voluntary tissue dispenser!

We do learn that we have to decypher our communication strategies to come to core products, which was the intention to eat a decent sandwich in this peticular case.

The questions seem to never stop.

Where is this place called alternative markets after Germany has a history of green politics, they had hippie too, and they are rather accademically thinking, yet the author can not  find a job that has anything to do with permaculture technologies. 

Google, spits out! First some products like the described paper bag with system, than regular IT jobs around Berlin and than all the institutes that teach and charge to become a permaculture designer, as if permaculture is a family based, in rare cases taught and not industrialized part of a none-excisting economy. {{The author}} himself found out about Manobu's _______ teachings and Bill ______ adaptions to permaculture just two years ago, yet it changed his view on technolog as well and would save the industry actual money if applied properly. Properly executed grassroots development saves debugging and mantainance of of outdated programs and overall costs, a wait-and-see-what-naturally-grows - in a more enclosed sense  - would make tech development comparable to harvesting fruitful and juicy code from the web fields and wineyards.

After returning to Berlin, questions pain {{the author}}. It truely is a sign to wake up from the trip. Insomnia, herting liver, without continuning the constant change of locality fatigue add to {{his|her|its}} field of emotions.

{{He]She|It}} looks at the world with diffirent eyes, realizing that hypermotivated self-enslavement by those parking in the tech startup scene, neither have found new ways of social integrity, not does anyone do anything else but reinventing the wheel. Why would one after seeing nothingness, ones and the simplest human emotions and natural greatness with people enchanted by their passions of real communication, return to fugures and numbers? After seeing people giving up financial security because they despice the customers that come to their performance space to park their Louis Vuitton carrying {{girlfriend's|boyfriend's|machinefriend's}} and some Belgian beer?
