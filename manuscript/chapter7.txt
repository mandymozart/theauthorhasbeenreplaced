### Self-marketing,

The outside view,
the jobs in the indusry,
your portfolio showing only "art", those things of pleasure, those things showing how you want to be.
It reminds {{the author}} of an advertisment professor who was doing projects with "Weisser Ring" about aid for disabled people, yet his assignments at Schol&Friends were campaigns for Lucky Strike - A convinced non-smoker!

The question is this: Where are we pushing society, when we push expectations of each other by showing off a lifestyle rather tahn an actual body of work? For the contemporary modern persona, one must be able to produce music, one must be able to draw, to blog about the latest in sound and fashion, one must not sell his artwork. 

	"Which role am I playing right now?"

{{The author}} feels like he is playing the morally untouchable preacher, white collar unfailable, yet {{he|she|it}} is being pushed there by a mixture of a no-show date and the ongoing braunloop of not able to find a job without a computer involved. {{He|She|It}} is playing the social critic, blaming the placce he is at for his own misery. Too spoiled to handle anything money related. On the right motivation {{he|she|it}} can handle anything-in a depressed moody vibe with a bit of rain and not a single bit of success, {{he|she|it}} feels like being not qualified for anything. The role {{he|she|it}} is playing, is the role {{he|she|it}} can not find. This uncertainty to be in the middle, not the center of everything, like Zahnbelag between {{his|her|its}} teeth, like cigarettes between classes. {{He|She|It}} feels sorry about cheating the system of education, figuring out and complaing about its stupidity and its discrimination. How it tries to categorize people and what they have to do in order to function for society/companies. If {{he|she|it}} would have only choosen not to be able to cheat. Was it lazyness that made {{him|her|it}} choose a new role everyday, defending it as if somebody else could swear on {{his|her|its}} mother, threating {{his|her|its}} en face (sig) with ignorance of their knowledge. {{The author}} pities {{himself|herself|itself}} for never doing a non-academic job, for {{he|she|it}} can not value the value of little work, that slowly sums up to a respectable amount. {{His|Her|Its}} expenses would have always exceeded his earnings. In a way, very respectbale for a member of a capatilist society {{he|she|it}} doesn't want to be a member of, yet emigration would mean ... the loop!

{{The author}} tries to imagine a future society, future of a a world one can hardly belief its linearity, future of a present world whose language simplified, died, or replaced by one of signs, symbols and logos of brands, cults, clubs, digital entities that are multilayered and will reveal more about function than sense.

Will there bureaucracy?
Will there be government?

Yes, but it will be privatized to many extends, and yes it will be made up of even more bureaucracy than we can imagine right now. Companies, enthusiastic individuals, national, regional law-making, localizations - the full extend of global-local, the omni-presence of many gods in a flat hierachy, 

or the individual will determine his sphere of influence. People will be bound, tied to there immidiate "sphere of gods", sets of rules. For example, {{the author}} is trying once again to take a train from Berlin to Augsburg.  {{The author's}} Deutsche Bahn discount card expired. {{He|She|It}} failed to pay the anual subscription fee on time. A new card is obsolete, yet existent bound to the rules of the contract. The regulation is that {{he|she|it}} pays fulls price and on future display of the renewed card once it is eventually issued, the traveller receives the discount minus a 15,00 EUR fee. To avoid this not so easy to comprehend set of rules a friend suggested to book a ticket via LTUR, an external travel agaency, where unreserved seats are sold low-budget and last-minute. Yet, those tickets a legally bound to online tickets and {{the author}} printing them on {{him|her|its}} own. What happens: {{The author}} arrives in a hurry at Berlin main station, wishing to fullfill two of the requirements. 

A: to find a place for printing the ticket
B: get to the right train in time (tickets are bound to booked trains only)

{{The author}} trusting  {{his|her|its}} personal set of experience and eventually false hopes from previous journeys fails in both tasks on the agenda - 
complete failure!

Compete failure!
Asking for a printing option is replied by a harsh reminder that one is supposed to have a printer at home at first response. Secondly, after insisting on an advice if there is anybody else in the train station to solve this task, in exchange of a small or large fee self-speaking, is replied by "we are not a place to know this", and thirdly referring {{the author}} to track #2 to the train to Munich asking for the train to Augsburg. {{The author}} improvises after {{he|she|it}} realized time is running short and the bespoken train to Munich is about to depart only 5 minutes delayed. A tourist information center is consulted about the service of providing a print out, yet rejects {{the author}} referring to their rules of service to not let clients access computers by the employers, which to some surprise has not been the initial request whatsoever. On the question if there is another option anywhere in reach of time and space, {{the author}} is referred to a hotel next to the station closer to the German parliament than a terrorist snipper would ever get. The options are narrowing down!

{{The author}} can not miss the train and take the next one, as before said, LTUR tickets are bound to certain specific trains. {{He|She|It}} decides to give it a try and rushes to the train on track #2 no matter what!

The train departs 10 minutes past schedule.

{{The author}} ends up paying again full price, yet the train keeper tried to scan the online ticket of {{the author's}} laptop screen. There the train keeper (female) realizes that {{the author}} should have been inanother train upstairs on another track.

	{{The author}} concludes: 

	"To many gods to make single adjustments, if one does not constantly adjust the final goal or destination depending on the course of {{his|her|its}} own path. Yet, if {{he|she|it}} fails to trust the omen that {{his|her|its}} regular gods have to offer, even a traditional concept such as intercity travel can become an unstable ride."

{{The author}} meditates over an organic instant Deutsche Bahn Flammkuchen Elsa√üer Art and a portion of instant Chilli con Carne, realizing its been the most common situation an alian from outer space could experience and imagining how this situation would require a 4 kid family of non-German-speaking origin weeks of mental training to withhold complete madness or self-diffusation.

{{The author}} continued to write about {{his|her|its}} experience a couple of days after {{he|she|it}} returned from Munich. The original intend was to return straight after the gig at City Club, but plans are to be taken light headed after 6 AM gigs anyhow. {{He|She|It}} found out later that the actual second ticket and respectivly fourth ticket sold to {{the author}} on the way back were regular fullprice tickets, not even liabil for partial discount at all.

{{The author}} mubles a prayer to all gods:

"Love Complex systems - love simplified approaches!
Must love irony, must love omni-present diversity and infinite levels of problems and their solutions.
Must love the meaning of loving everything, since even that is a self-centered directive.
{{The author}} can love the eternal imperfection of the world, 
{{the author}} can love the illusion to be capabile to systemize it, 
{{the author}} can love higher beings for keeping it all together,
{{the author}} can love complex explainations why all of this is so complex 
and {{the author}} could also love one another."

You don't want to live my life, yet again: You live the same."
