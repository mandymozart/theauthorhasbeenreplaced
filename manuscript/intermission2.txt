# Die Unendliche Geschichte!

{{The author}} does not want the {{girl|boy|machine}} that wants {{the author}} to be unhappy, yet {{he|she|it}} does not love {{her|him|it}} vice versa. {{The author}}'s ego is trying to get more space. There were much more reasons to move to {{her|his|its}} city and there is so many things and people met, that ending the affair will eventually cut ties to a new univers. The {{girl|boy|machine}} is too much in love to understand {{the author's}} rationality and lust of life. {{The author}} may never see Vienna ever again, yet {{he|she|it}} learned too much loving is blindness and language never enough to tell the heart. {{The author}} realizes, that writing is aufgehen of the self into the text and from there that thought is bound there forever. There is no return from the text. The whole point of putting words into a greater distribution is to make it last forever. Like carving a heart with a couple's initials into the bork of a tree. It will last longer than their life spans - that my friend is called eternity amongst the human race. 

Claiming possessions, calling their prescious, idealizing one another in the mind of the other, ownership, exclusivity of emotion, of trust, of care against the vast randomness of radical individualisation. The 21th century first renders the generations bound useless. It broke the tie between creation and recreation between {{parents|creators}} and {{offspring|creations}}. {{The maker}} is the {{the author}} that is virtually everybodies collective mind and possible because societies capabilities and moral grounds have shifted. Satisfaction is repeatable. Fertility is made in labs. {{The author}} acknowledges of course the traditional concept of god's creation, yet is also conscious of humanity believing to have taken over that natural law. The duality of imagination and realization is opening a new horizon, not just to hump, but to be connected to more and more minds and possible interpretations of the univers. This is the century where imagionation has become reality. 

Cyberspace is real and a life,
is taken over!

As {{the author}} is becoming more creative, {{he|she|it}} is creating the world around {{him|her|it}}.
