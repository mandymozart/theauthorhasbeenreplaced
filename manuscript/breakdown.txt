# (Another) Breakdown

When {{the author}} themes a peticular problem into {{his|her|its}} consciousness, it is real, therefore most relevant in its existence.

Dear beloved reader, you have to understand that {{the author}} at this very moment is very uncertain about a huge Raggae soundsystem that Kevin aka The Bug is having delivered to the studio on Wednesday morning not having a slight idea about the actual measures of the beast. "It is 5 o'clock in the morning. I haven't slept enough, my brain is like a hyperactive ninja, who's in everybodies mind, but nowhere to be seen. Just now I was sitting in bed talking to mylsef, tired of multiple solutions close to tears and transforming it into written words."

The written not computeized word is a relief. It challenges progress, it disrespects stress, even if one writes fast, it is merely behind {{the author's}} thought. The digital revolution is apparently the first time that we collectively are trying to world-in-existence (sic) what can be written, published and read even before the concept is formed in ones mind. Interfaces are made for direct response. We get to read mind status updates from people that never dared to speak their mind on a hourly rate. Almost like quantums our thoughts wandered/will wander in the continuity/spot/loop of time. Everything is said and heard. Our world's explaination drives people into absurd states of consciousness. 

This is why {{the author}} is writing this book. A trip book! A trip we did not decide to take. It has been always our parents generations trip. Throwing acid and writing books was posthumly (lat. past ones life) regarded the thing todo for the intectual avant garde of the hippies, pre or post. Their aim to question our mindset, constantly questioning is driving us, if we want or not. The liberation of complexity and unreasonability invisibility of war, that we can not tell major wrong doings, and blame it only on our confusion - ALL THESE MAKE OUR WORLD, one that can not judge in cross (im großen ganzen).

{{The author}} chose a conservative position, something very very undercomplex to return to a state of balance. The visions, the hopes of free people's minds drive humanity mad. On this planet we populate, we die in greater amounts than ever, we estinguish other populations and our selves, yet the only thing we put our focus on is the Zen timer app in our iphone, developed by a generation of 20 year old technocrates and trans-humanists in the metropolies of our world. {{The author}} also notices that Yom Ki-Pur was ones building a regime of terror based on the judgement of unspoiled childrens minds. The Red Khmer executed the youngsters judgement on spot in the hope of forming a true socialist society. 

We have to trust our children, that is the exchange between the generations, yet our children will make every one of us unemployed by developing software that generates money out of keeping people occupied witht he cycle of thought, contribution and reconsumption mentioned earlier in this chapter, {{the author}} would like to title: "Night of the mad".

Next to the authors bed, three books have found their way into the narative: Gravities Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon, a sureal mindfuck about the psychodelic experience of German V2 bombardments of London - living regular lifes just infront of an execution squad with their fingers pulling the trigger any time. Instant death by chance is much more likely than being hit by a lightning, yet even without a thunerstorm accompanying the coming doom. A novum of human terror that pushed our consciousness most definitely further into remaining and feeling comfortable in a single "frame" of time - a new nowness (sic) or timelessness. Yet, the book is surprisingly optimistic. There is no food and lots of rats, but it describes how for a whole generation to come decissions are already made. Whom to bed with, what's the weather tomorrow, because whether if it is sunny or rainy a bomb is going to drop or not.

A - {{the author}} almost forgot to mention two very important facts. The weapon system is today's most relevant psychology wherever we European motherfucking intellectual hypocrits are not or mine for humanstock, oil or silicium to build the warheads that one day, if wealth/Wohlstand can eventually be forced onto each human person beyond Stuttgart or Nothing Hill (sic). Maybe to the slight variation of yet a similar loop concept: "Wohlstand without progress", something {{the author}} has to dig his head into to understand the fundamental nessecity. 

Fact two, this book was recommended to {{the author}} through the internet post of a friend on Facebook, who rose to fame and was in a terrifying sociopathy when they first met {{her|him|it}} back in the day. {{She|He|It}} was in the same age as back than as {{the author}} is right now.

The latter fact is also interesting because it is part of the original intention of writing this very morning, that problems one addresses manifest in our consciousness and depending on how much you materialize or bring them to life, others and yourself suffer badly from it.

Mediate, Meditate, Medina.

{{The author}} is getting to a point, and tries resting his soul for a little longer in his pillows skipping to mention the other two books next to {{him|her|it}}. For referenceability: "10 Billion" - Stephen Emmott and "Raumpioniere in ländlichen Regionen" - Edition Bauhaus Dessau
