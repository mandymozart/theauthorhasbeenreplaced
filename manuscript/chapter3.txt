### We need the internet, the internet needs us!

Our collective memory is accessable freely to everyone. To not communicate is impossible, yet communicating requires decision making that is well formed. Anything we think has consequences not only to ourselves, but in a globalized world to everyone on the planet. If we limit our field of impact 
by language spaces,
by borders,
by addressing a core group,
by defining a core group,
by denying a core group,
we blend out this impact from our consciousness.

Our moral so to say ultimately will in each and every moment reshape allowing us to comfortably exist in this omnimoral world. 

[img=moral-space-model]

We do this by constantly connecting thought and impression locally to people abroad. Global has local impact. And not only on the ecosystem but the social environment which those moral spaces are made of. This concept is not a novelity to the globalized world, but was possible to globalize and again becomes something that gives us opportunity to think about
religion,
time,
society,
space,
moral,
us,
the world,
our home,
and place in a way that appears to be left out in the age of nationalism. 

{{The author}} does not blief that nationalism has become impossible to maintain, yet there will be only one nation, a nation of house, a house of nation. We are so international! {{The author}} climbs out of bed. A beautiful {{boy|vixen|machine}} turns around yarning, {{his|her|its}} eyes slightly opened, trying to get a glimpse {{his|her|its}} arm. {{He|She|It}} openes the curtains into the garden, leaps back a little, puts on a shirt and plainly says: 
"Guten Morgen"
"Ohio"
"일러나서?"
"Bonjour", they met last night, yet actully it has been a few weeks before, yet {{he|she|it}} still can't remember {{his|her|its} name.
"Just sleep a little longer if you like. I got to head out. Maybe see you in two weeks ..." 

As {{the author}} waves throught the door with his little trolley he is on the phone calling a cab. Arriving at the airport he remembers a few people might be happy to see {{his|her|its}} face once he gets to Seoul. {{He|She|It}} sends about a dozen emails, SMS and other kinds of messages with those digital doves and adds a bunch of emoticons and 에모지. A few reply, {{his|her|its}} fear is sorting already what might have changed their lives. Surprisingly {{he|she|it}} hears back from a friend, who says {{HE|SHE|IT}} is back on track, much better than last year. That's good news. As {{the author}} boards the airplane to Istanbul {{he|she|it}} slowly feels the headache arising from last nights party. It has been a beautiful conversation with a close friend and like minded thinker. They haven't been talking in a while, yet their need for exchange clearly was undoubtable. 

Both friends drank a bottle or two of redwine, did some speed to keep awake and while the age pyramide was analyzed as a gigantic mushroom opportunity to free our generation from our self-contained parents one by simply waiting and sitting it out. They came to the conclusion that the experiment that Berlin is living will clearly not require them to work for a real living ever. A danish friend has given the friend a very small amout of DMT, a rare liquid extract from the liane trees in South America, usually used in combination with MAO blockers in Ayavasca ceremonies. The Dane got the DMT from the canister of a self-made shaman that brought the drug to Europe with the intend to enlighten the stupid white men. This in-between man has possibly taken more psychodelics than Riccardo Villalobos in the imagination of the collective party growd in his entire life. The challenge was actually somethwat excisting in real, yet both could not define themselves as such. {{The author}} knew about the substanze's effects from a recorded talk by T.C.McKenna and the videos remixes made by the in-between producer in tribute to the very same. He illustrated the experience with much fractal extra-vaganza on the windows of a two story flat above Warschauer Straße at the time. Interested, yet a little scared about taking what is supposed to be the strongest psychodelic drug that exists in what we call "nature", {{the author}} accepts {{his|her|its}} friends offer. 

Before was after. As if one would look at Disneyland through the phantasy of a hyperactive Japanese kid or cartoon artist. Voice and vision tear in any dimension.
A fractalized ever abstracting compelixity of granular precission unfolds.
Everything makes sense.
Everyone was right and will be.
And, yes event the Mormons were right that white linen-dressed shining guy called Jesus was reincarnated after his resurrection to the Inka and saved them from their own stupidy and unjustice. {{The author}} can not help {{himself|herself|itself}} to notice similaries to the mission of the shaman who brought this God's portion to Europe, that {{he|she|it}} just smoked. Actually, the author is in doubt whoes existence to deny afterall. That of Jesus or the Inka. While {{he|she|it}} trips his friend or Jesus kind of reads some instructions, telling {{the author}} an approximate end to all of this. "Five minutes", he said. Now the number appears in his imaginary third eye. It's counting down and again bursting in thousand particles. "The author, you are back". // ??? the author in this case with out replacement?
Immidiatelly the rumours about Steve Jobs doing DMT trips on a daily basis gain enourmous gravity to {{the author's}} consciousness.

In the bullet train to Istanbul {{the author}} is sitting with a group of drunken Korean business men and a plastic surgically modified {{boy|girl|machine}} with hazelnut dyed hair. {{He|She|It}} pretends to use the toilet to grasp a little more of {{his|her|its}} statue. {{He|She|It}} partly hides {{his|her|its}} face under a tank hat, yet {{the author's}} curiosity is kept alive. {{He|She|It}} twists every once in a while, centered by {{his|her|its}} cellphone.

{{The author}} prejudicially speculates, that {{he|she|it}} must be

A - a rich child, with no interests whatsover

B - a famous friend of a person {{he|she|it}} knows, like singer, actor or something else vaguely significant,

or 

C - an individual stylist, a woman of vogue, someone he could fall in love with possibly?

Yet, {{the author}} will never know for he is not used to to talk to {{boys|girls|machines}} without an accidential introduction. Conicidence keeps {{him|her|it}} going. 

"I would love to be {{him|her|it}} even for just one instant.", not noticing he just was.

Was also the steward, was also the suitman and his wife seated across the ile. But first class is new, never done on one of those KTX. The tables in the fronting seats unfold with limitation, so wrtiting with pen becomes an uncomfortable task, yet again he thinks that using a computer could solve this and again the design was not mistaken. Now {{the author}} also realizes now the agitated twist of the, he lost a little interest in {{him|her|it}} by now, child around her butter bread sized smartphone had something todo with the comfort of the compartment. The window glass and darkness outside form a perfect mirror {{he|she|it}} see {{his|her|its}} inside, as the {{boy|girl|machine}} checking {{his|her|its}} outside. 

{{He|She|It}} gets of one stop before at Athens {{he|she|it}} beliefs to have read a sign. In Istanbul he arrives at a newer airport at the Asian side and has to wait a decent now hour and a half at immigration. A beautiful demonstartion of attitude towards Europe. The Turkish authorities must be pissed of about Europe repulsion towards their admitance towards each citizen of the EU individually, {{the author}} thinks. {{He|She|It}} is hungry and tired and distracts {{himself|herself|itself}} with a game on words that {{he|she|it}} found in a commercial that runs on a screen.

"실라리안"
Shilla,
Ryan,
rien,
de rien,
rien ne va plus,
ca c'est le Arian,
non mon ami, it's more like the Germans, those Mongolians, and those Koreans, those Shillarians, the one Shillarian. Disturbed {{he|she|it}} resignates and finally is picked up by this dude sent to pick {{him|her|it}} up to him to Taksim In three weeks time this place will be filled with tear gas for weeks. {{He|She|It}} takes a nap It is 2 pm and {{he|she|it}} drops down in the bed. Later that night {{the author}} makes his way through an emtied out Taksim. No more chairs on the street, by now even Alcohol in general is supposed to be forbidden, yet for th beholder to judge if that somewhat simple drug should be regulated and what Mohammed was doing to distract {{himself|herself|itself}}. Supposingly standing the sun for quite some time till he halluzinated, {{the author}} reckons. There is a rumor that buddhist monks after planting rice get high on some rice brew, those German purity laws of the time has become irrelevant for it is manifested in the entire world for beer producer spirit and marketing campaigns, banned Klatschmohn (sig) and other very interesting additionals, ask T.C.McKenna, limited local decission making processes. 

From there afeter many Swiss Kapuziner monks at St. Romaine, the first ministry in the Laussagne alps and the entire psychodelic Switzerland weere not able to report of enlightenment and being able to see brother Joseph for example levitate in the monestries compound. A skills lost that went parallel with losing spirituality to protestantism. 

Acknowkledging god's world as some worldly entity, that could easily be translated by a mortal such as Luther would definitely stear up our world order. On the other hand, {{the author}} was thinking about the use of drugs and a specific spiritual mindset and tries to see parallels between the urge to mission and the emergetic progressive movement-imperialism is not only a purely protestant world order, but one other key player was most certainly the Roman Catholic Church and the Spanish Inquisition. Yet, their explaination of burning the world to a flat disc is a rather clear and convincing argumentation to many. 

The world itself is powerless-we change consciousness with our body-we marter as the potlac trade does, we give parts of our body to Boudrillar or give control to Foucault and let's drop some more: throw our selves authority to Paik Nam Jun's and Kessler's techno images. In general there is a movement that we love our body-become a modern universal Geist-same ghosts that Sam Hess, a tree seminar Jodler sees transcendet in every thing, but the radio. Not sure, if he talks about recorded or broadcasted sound waves, and where does our voice lose its powers? When are we not able to speak or is it rather being heard? 

Muteness:
politically, idealistically, silence is golden, the monetary monestry, messaging like a massage foru our hearing vessels, bursting loud disco and EDM sound in the small side street, Babylon club is reacherd, the dark eyed femme fatale booked {{the author}} to this place appears with her recent affection. He smells like Raki and of course the best cure for a hangover-it tastes like medicine anyhow and promises Absinth like behaviors.

He climbs the DJ both whih is a Hochsitz (sig) - in deer hunting used balcony - on top of the Absinth bar in Berlin's undoubtly only legal crack house.

A hole inside Samsung,
self-reliability of technology critiques as well as supporters and key players,
dealers, the owners are the dealers,
living in Mexico to escape the Berlin void of winter,
those having insight know that it is
not nice to start a conversation with mentioning who your enemies are.
"You are fighting with yourself for sometime."

{{The author}} got the answers, yet he was incapable to sum it up or keep those experiences of the various drugs induced during the visit and by all the people in the place.
That said, a major problem to the most convienient answer.

{{The author}} asks hiimself if Seoul is really the next Berlin.

Let's do a small case study on what the opportunities could be in either city. {{The author}} regards opportunity as a social and ecological relation, that attracts people to dedicate their output, because all humans output and benefit mankind no matter what and where they are. Concepts of egoism or hermetism are also part of our world or since we are poart of a greater ecosystem call it sonscious world. Anything is relevant to each one minding.

Urban cities have one primary motor, that's the ont that shapes the city and in some cases creates it from scratch. Cities exist longer than people therefor these city shaping processes that attract people are usually rapid development or a stabilizing living-ability (in terms of quality of living). On the other hand for global economic players, change is more preferable, because on the scale of a city-municipal [it] mobilizes people, especially there are two ideologies that seem to be the driving motor of economic growth, whenever a third world country experiences major growth. Human population needs to fuel both work fore and secondly consumerism. 

It does make sense, also it would explain the active interest in foreign economic involvement into centers of growth. Those influencers create a market and yet do not interfer into the origins liviability. {{The author}} sounds contra dicting {{himself|herself|itself}}, but also growth can be very uncomfortable as well. It requires sudden changes and constantly adapting concepts. This not very difficult, yet important realisation was once mentioned by a one of the German ambassadors during a podium at the meeting of the ASEAN states German economy meeting in Grand Hyatt Hotel, which {{the author}} attended in casual street wear for a Seoul based online newspaper ("The Seoul Times", a rather mediocre journalist organ back in 1492). Later on {{the author}} gained further insights into the thinking process of major global companies when attending various meetings with an informal group of neo-liberal intellectuals, business men and politicians called Gananan Forum, due an conincidential encounter with the son of a Korean ferry company operating lines from Incheon to Tianjin. A few years after this first encounter the son tried to established some human aid company and other abstract business concepts and was unsuccessfully running for congressman in 2011. This person used the word friend, yet the author thinks it was used merely for reasons of qualifying his reputation as an international scholar.

	{{The author}} accidentially or systematically developed an approach of loss to determine true friends. Only those remaining in contact after, what the {{the author}} calls a social access black out, in situations as losing {{his|her|its}} phone or deleting all email addresses during operating system failures or the social suicide of social media identities, had potential to create long lasting friendships in the first place.

After meeting up with his friend a couple of times {{he]she|it}} realizes, "True friends means something else, because true friends are like true love. They become family!" The author thinks about the 902 facebook friends {{he]she|it}} just added to his 3rd account and realizes how profitably people are. The vast facebook empire is chaning from one position, that of being a place for people to connect and share virtual stuff with other interested people around the globe, to a place where all these friends grow up from being college students to just photos in a year book vunerable to minor marketing approaches. 

{{The author}} reckons every 3rd invoersoty commoliton he had is probably now facebook markting for Zalando or Nike or any other Berlin based startup. 

Which brings up another aspect of evolving markets:
