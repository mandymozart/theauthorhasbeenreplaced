A generative trip love story





### Prependix - Basel 2013


It's August, a lovely hot summer day. {{The author}} quits his job as a frontend-developer for a online language school due to moral concerns about the purpose and usefulness of the enterprise and the methods of work. In the following weeks he has about 6000,00 EUR of dirty money left. {{He|She|It}} is invited to Basel for an Arte exhibit and live streaming show, starting point of a trip that is going to last for more than a year and takes {{the author}} around the world and other universes, times and moral grounds.

There is only one rule: Take any trip offered or possible, if others gone there before!

The prependix is describing some of the initial Ω, {{the author}} had on his mind when {{he|she|it}} decided subconsciously to embark on this journey.

#### Der Tunnel // translate or not?

Überlegungen zum Problem der Schaffung von Übergangszonen

Im Gespräch mit Birgit Kempker fiel dem Author auf, das wir versuchnte die Kunst als eine Tunnelfahrt zu definieren, bei dessen Durchfahrt man sich den Blick, den Einfluß der Umwelt entzieht, und dadruch den Tunnel erweitern, bzw. verschieben kann. Ein temporäres Exil, eine Eremitage.

Was interessant ist, daß nicht nur ein solches Verhalten in der Kunst relevant ist, doch auch auf andere Bereiche der Gesellschaft übertragbar ist. Der Tunnel ist Fokus, er hat eine zweite Eigenschaft, die mir erst jetzt auf der Fahrt durch die Alpen (wort-wörtlich) auffällt. Der Tunnel blockt auch die Ablenkung derer die in den Tunnel gehen - schauklappen-artig.

Man stelle sich vor: "Guten Tag".

Schauklappen gibt es aber in der wissenschaftlichen Methodik enorm viel, und ihre Effizienz ist unglaublich, gesteigert und mental eine Herausforderung.
Die Zugreise im Klimawagen, das anthroposofische Naturerlebnisparadox der Autobahn 45° Fahrwagen, Seaworld Unterwasserfahrten, der Zoo, die Schleuse im Labor, der Pförtner an der Universität, doch auch der Kittel des Arztes oder das Thema des Textes, das Ziel des Weges, oder die Reinheit der Tugend, die Leere der Utopie.

Der Tunnel ist eine Schnellstraße der Progression. 

Beinahe vergaß ich die Entrückung der Wurzel durch das Flugzeug, dem schnellsten der erwerbbaren Globalen Tunnelfahrten. Er ermöglicht uns Sachen, denen wir per Konzept für unser Weiterkommen keine Bedeutung zuordnen zu überfliegen.
Die mir zuwiedere Gilde der Marketing und Datenanalysten setz uns verstärkt solchen Tunneln unfreiwillig aus. Sie schaffen auf Basis ihrer Analysen individuelle Informationstunnel und leiten uns an Produkten vorbei für die nur wir eventuell empfänglich sind, ergo eine Art Tunnel der maximalen Ablenkung, so empfinde ich dies und verliere meine Geduld, dem Medium noch Hoffnung zu geben, sein Potential zu entwickeln.

Die Tunnel werden intelligent. Sie handeln um und mit unseren Gedanken, verändern ihre Gestalt und werden ambivalenter, jedoch sind diese noch solche die wir uns selber ersteinmal geschaffen haben. 


#### Sprachcodierung

Das chemische Latein ist der Versuch Sprache zu codieren, die Zufälle auszuschalten.


#### Argumentationstechniken am Beispiel des Martin Downey Jr. Films

Es ist schwer einen gefühlt gesunden harmonischen Standpunkt zu vertreten, da alle Positionen von der Politik belegt sind. Wörter wie links, rechts, mitte, vorn und hinten bekommen eine Tragweite, die es unmöglich macht nicht durch reine Verbalisierung zerlegt bzw. invertiert zu werden.

### Preface

Ration, logic, the cybernetic space, like rails guiding our steps. Those trakcers watching out like our own humble brohther would do, or even omre effective, precise, accurate, and visionary forcasting possible dangers and success, warning us of failure, helping us to foster profits, master relationships, and coexistence with friends, colleagues or enemies alike. Our world in little, as well the global system in meta is bound to written, unspoken and continiously changing narratives. From primitve reaction based learning processes we made our world a hyper complicated and interconnected environment. From stones and stones laws, to stone print, and stoning law enforcement, to beheading on a stone, to silizium sand, to gravestones. From beatung bats, to firewood and spears and humble buddhist print and cat, and pencil arcitects delight to lasercut. It seems like we managed to *intelligize* almost any material on this known world to help or transport our knowledge, our given social rules. 

Humanity (an idea of our mind in an understanding of being part of a greater unity prior to the transhumanist ideas) also started to go beyond and construct based upon simple technologies by far more complex abstractions or as some would call it definitions. We are able to communicate entities that literally have no body but the power to be harder to remove and more persistent than the mysterius exculibur, also an abstraction related to the stone methaphor. We managed to merge virtual and physical world, yet we fail to connnect the digital and industrial world with the natural resources we inherited. Our mind, as Goether referred to as Geist goes far beyond our body. It requires external fueling to be kept alive. There is a variety of possibel mistakes in invention that led up to our current status quo. For example during the introduction of memory, which as a theoretical concept consists of reader, writer and preserver. The latter one wasn't able to realize, yet the economic demand pushed the development and unleashed this technology to form the base of our digital consciousness - examplary for the unsustainability of our thinking decision making process.

In the course of this book {{the author}} will try to remark various further examples of originally extremly wise concepts that upon initialisation turned into buggy nightmares that generations of {{users|clients|citizen}} and {{suppliers|producers|developers}} have to deal with. {{The author}} has developed a personal fetish on idiocraties for enjoyment and pleasure. One may concider those things jokes, yet the joke is with those that give birth to these, let's simply call them taradox (technological paradoxes), and leave ever bigger "jokes" to future generations.

But this shall not be the concern of this text, yet it is trying to find a way of thinking, development that unites concepts of reason and logic with those unreasonable. Geist and Körper and Space. Us in us that surrounds us. The rational academic me in the body bound to the lawes of nature within the ever changing boundaries of social exchange with every"thing".

/* 

Part of this text is translated and extended from the authors diploma thesis, back than written in German for unexplainable reasons. The author will leave those sections untranslateable as is, since choosing a languge has major influence on the strategy of thought - so does choosing language for thought as Monkeys decided not to develop language. Nevertheless those initial thoughts and analysis were about the nature of presets, a technocratic vocabulary that made its way into our culture, almost unnoticibly for they have been aesthetically outlawed, yet shape the majority of "our" production.

Other sections are thought throught snippets from exhibitions and a collection of "instable casual reasoning".
The text is ordered and categorized by keywords rather than chapters. Some are interludes, random statistics and individual archaic darma form, freeform paragraphs and listings for tutorials. {{The author}} attempts to use the vast variety of available language and explainatory imagery to illustrate the issue as clear as nessecarily possible to be googleable and [unreadable]. Each solution has void-void for comments, void for rest.

May only a few be offended, and those that are, shall not sue {{the author}} or take it personal for the text is yet another virtual entity, that by not thinking about it ceases existence in ablinz.

### We need the internet, the internet needs us!

Our collective memory is accessable freely to everyone. To not communicate is impossible, yet communicating requires decision making that is well formed. Anything we think has consequences not only to ourselves, but in a globalized world to everyone on the planet. If we limit our field of impact 
by language spaces,
by borders,
by addressing a core group,
by defining a core group,
by denying a core group,
we blend out this impact from our consciousness.

Our moral so to say ultimately will in each and every moment reshape allowing us to comfortably exist in this omnimoral world. 

[img=moral-space-model]

We do this by constantly connecting thought and impression locally to people abroad. Global has local impact. And not only on the ecosystem but the social environment which those moral spaces are made of. This concept is not a novelity to the globalized world, but was possible to globalize and again becomes something that gives us opportunity to think about
religion,
time,
society,
space,
moral,
us,
the world,
our home,
and place in a way that appears to be left out in the age of nationalism. 

{{The author}} does not blief that nationalism has become impossible to maintain, yet there will be only one nation, a nation of house, a house of nation. We are so international! {{The author}} climbs out of bed. A beautiful {{boy|vixen|machine}} turns around yarning, {{his|her|its}} eyes slightly opened, trying to get a glimpse {{his|her|its}} arm. {{He|She|It}} openes the curtains into the garden, leaps back a little, puts on a shirt and plainly says: 
"Guten Morgen"
"Ohio"
"일러나서?"
"Bonjour", they met last night, yet actully it has been a few weeks before, yet {{he|she|it}} still can't remember {{his|her|its} name.
"Just sleep a little longer if you like. I got to head out. Maybe see you in two weeks ..." 

As {{the author}} waves throught the door with his little trolley he is on the phone calling a cab. Arriving at the airport he remembers a few people might be happy to see {{his|her|its}} face once he gets to Seoul. {{He|She|It}} sends about a dozen emails, SMS and other kinds of messages with those digital doves and adds a bunch of emoticons and 에모지. A few reply, {{his|her|its}} fear is sorting already what might have changed their lives. Surprisingly {{he|she|it}} hears back from a friend, who says {{HE|SHE|IT}} is back on track, much better than last year. That's good news. As {{the author}} boards the airplane to Istanbul {{he|she|it}} slowly feels the headache arising from last nights party. It has been a beautiful conversation with a close friend and like minded thinker. They haven't been talking in a while, yet their need for exchange clearly was undoubtable. 

Both friends drank a bottle or two of redwine, did some speed to keep awake and while the age pyramide was analyzed as a gigantic mushroom opportunity to free our generation from our self-contained parents one by simply waiting and sitting it out. They came to the conclusion that the experiment that Berlin is living will clearly not require them to work for a real living ever. A danish friend has given the friend a very small amout of DMT, a rare liquid extract from the liane trees in South America, usually used in combination with MAO blockers in Ayavasca ceremonies. The Dane got the DMT from the canister of a self-made shaman that brought the drug to Europe with the intend to enlighten the stupid white men. This in-between man has possibly taken more psychodelics than Riccardo Villalobos in the imagination of the collective party growd in his entire life. The challenge was actually somethwat excisting in real, yet both could not define themselves as such. {{The author}} knew about the substanze's effects from a recorded talk by T.C.McKenna and the videos remixes made by the in-between producer in tribute to the very same. He illustrated the experience with much fractal extra-vaganza on the windows of a two story flat above Warschauer Straße at the time. Interested, yet a little scared about taking what is supposed to be the strongest psychodelic drug that exists in what we call "nature", {{the author}} accepts {{his|her|its}} friends offer. 

Before was after. As if one would look at Disneyland through the phantasy of a hyperactive Japanese kid or cartoon artist. Voice and vision tear in any dimension.
A fractalized ever abstracting compelixity of granular precission unfolds.
Everything makes sense.
Everyone was right and will be.
And, yes event the Mormons were right that white linen-dressed shining guy called Jesus was reincarnated after his resurrection to the Inka and saved them from their own stupidy and unjustice. {{The author}} can not help {{himself|herself|itself}} to notice similaries to the mission of the shaman who brought this God's portion to Europe, that {{he|she|it}} just smoked. Actually, the author is in doubt whoes existence to deny afterall. That of Jesus or the Inka. While {{he|she|it}} trips his friend or Jesus kind of reads some instructions, telling {{the author}} an approximate end to all of this. "Five minutes", he said. Now the number appears in his imaginary third eye. It's counting down and again bursting in thousand particles. "The author, you are back". // ??? the author in this case with out replacement?
Immidiatelly the rumours about Steve Jobs doing DMT trips on a daily basis gain enourmous gravity to {{the author's}} consciousness.

In the bullet train to Istanbul {{the author}} is sitting with a group of drunken Korean business men and a plastic surgically modified {{boy|girl|machine}} with hazelnut dyed hair. {{He|She|It}} pretends to use the toilet to grasp a little more of {{his|her|its}} statue. {{He|She|It}} partly hides {{his|her|its}} face under a tank hat, yet {{the author's}} curiosity is kept alive. {{He|She|It}} twists every once in a while, centered by {{his|her|its}} cellphone.

{{The author}} prejudicially speculates, that {{he|she|it}} must be

A - a rich child, with no interests whatsover

B - a famous friend of a person {{he|she|it}} knows, like singer, actor or something else vaguely significant,

or 

C - an individual stylist, a woman of vogue, someone he could fall in love with possibly?

Yet, {{the author}} will never know for he is not used to to talk to {{boys|girls|machines}} without an accidential introduction. Conicidence keeps {{him|her|it}} going. 

"I would love to be {{him|her|it}} even for just one instant.", not noticing he just was.

Was also the steward, was also the suitman and his wife seated across the ile. But first class is new, never done on one of those KTX. The tables in the fronting seats unfold with limitation, so wrtiting with pen becomes an uncomfortable task, yet again he thinks that using a computer could solve this and again the design was not mistaken. Now {{the author}} also realizes now the agitated twist of the, he lost a little interest in {{him|her|it}} by now, child around her butter bread sized smartphone had something todo with the comfort of the compartment. The window glass and darkness outside form a perfect mirror {{he|she|it}} see {{his|her|its}} inside, as the {{boy|girl|machine}} checking {{his|her|its}} outside. 

{{He|She|It}} gets of one stop before at Athens {{he|she|it}} beliefs to have read a sign. In Istanbul he arrives at a newer airport at the Asian side and has to wait a decent now hour and a half at immigration. A beautiful demonstartion of attitude towards Europe. The Turkish authorities must be pissed of about Europe repulsion towards their admitance towards each citizen of the EU individually, {{the author}} thinks. {{He|She|It}} is hungry and tired and distracts {{himself|herself|itself}} with a game on words that {{he|she|it}} found in a commercial that runs on a screen.

"실라리안"
Shilla,
Ryan,
rien,
de rien,
rien ne va plus,
ca c'est le Arian,
non mon ami, it's more like the Germans, those Mongolians, and those Koreans, those Shillarians, the one Shillarian. Disturbed {{he|she|it}} resignates and finally is picked up by this dude sent to pick {{him|her|it}} up to him to Taksim In three weeks time this place will be filled with tear gas for weeks. {{He|She|It}} takes a nap It is 2 pm and {{he|she|it}} drops down in the bed. Later that night {{the author}} makes his way through an emtied out Taksim. No more chairs on the street, by now even Alcohol in general is supposed to be forbidden, yet for th beholder to judge if that somewhat simple drug should be regulated and what Mohammed was doing to distract {{himself|herself|itself}}. Supposingly standing the sun for quite some time till he halluzinated, {{the author}} reckons. There is a rumor that buddhist monks after planting rice get high on some rice brew, those German purity laws of the time has become irrelevant for it is manifested in the entire world for beer producer spirit and marketing campaigns, banned Klatschmohn (sig) and other very interesting additionals, ask T.C.McKenna, limited local decission making processes. 

From there afeter many Swiss Kapuziner monks at St. Romaine, the first ministry in the Laussagne alps and the entire psychodelic Switzerland weere not able to report of enlightenment and being able to see brother Joseph for example levitate in the monestries compound. A skills lost that went parallel with losing spirituality to protestantism. 

Acknowkledging god's world as some worldly entity, that could easily be translated by a mortal such as Luther would definitely stear up our world order. On the other hand, {{the author}} was thinking about the use of drugs and a specific spiritual mindset and tries to see parallels between the urge to mission and the emergetic progressive movement-imperialism is not only a purely protestant world order, but one other key player was most certainly the Roman Catholic Church and the Spanish Inquisition. Yet, their explaination of burning the world to a flat disc is a rather clear and convincing argumentation to many. 

The world itself is powerless-we change consciousness with our body-we marter as the potlac trade does, we give parts of our body to Boudrillar or give control to Foucault and let's drop some more: throw our selves authority to Paik Nam Jun's and Kessler's techno images. In general there is a movement that we love our body-become a modern universal Geist-same ghosts that Sam Hess, a tree seminar Jodler sees transcendet in every thing, but the radio. Not sure, if he talks about recorded or broadcasted sound waves, and where does our voice lose its powers? When are we not able to speak or is it rather being heard? 

Muteness:
politically, idealistically, silence is golden, the monetary monestry, messaging like a massage foru our hearing vessels, bursting loud disco and EDM sound in the small side street, Babylon club is reacherd, the dark eyed femme fatale booked {{the author}} to this place appears with her recent affection. He smells like Raki and of course the best cure for a hangover-it tastes like medicine anyhow and promises Absinth like behaviors.

He climbs the DJ both whih is a Hochsitz (sig) - in deer hunting used balcony - on top of the Absinth bar in Berlin's undoubtly only legal crack house.

A hole inside Samsung,
self-reliability of technology critiques as well as supporters and key players,
dealers, the owners are the dealers,
living in Mexico to escape the Berlin void of winter,
those having insight know that it is
not nice to start a conversation with mentioning who your enemies are.
"You are fighting with yourself for sometime."

{{The author}} got the answers, yet he was incapable to sum it up or keep those experiences of the various drugs induced during the visit and by all the people in the place.
That said, a major problem to the most convienient answer.

{{The author}} asks hiimself if Seoul is really the next Berlin.

Let's do a small case study on what the opportunities could be in either city. {{The author}} regards opportunity as a social and ecological relation, that attracts people to dedicate their output, because all humans output and benefit mankind no matter what and where they are. Concepts of egoism or hermetism are also part of our world or since we are poart of a greater ecosystem call it sonscious world. Anything is relevant to each one minding.

Urban cities have one primary motor, that's the ont that shapes the city and in some cases creates it from scratch. Cities exist longer than people therefor these city shaping processes that attract people are usually rapid development or a stabilizing living-ability (in terms of quality of living). On the other hand for global economic players, change is more preferable, because on the scale of a city-municipal [it] mobilizes people, especially there are two ideologies that seem to be the driving motor of economic growth, whenever a third world country experiences major growth. Human population needs to fuel both work fore and secondly consumerism. 

It does make sense, also it would explain the active interest in foreign economic involvement into centers of growth. Those influencers create a market and yet do not interfer into the origins liviability. {{The author}} sounds contra dicting {{himself|herself|itself}}, but also growth can be very uncomfortable as well. It requires sudden changes and constantly adapting concepts. This not very difficult, yet important realisation was once mentioned by a one of the German ambassadors during a podium at the meeting of the ASEAN states German economy meeting in Grand Hyatt Hotel, which {{the author}} attended in casual street wear for a Seoul based online newspaper ("The Seoul Times", a rather mediocre journalist organ back in 1492). Later on {{the author}} gained further insights into the thinking process of major global companies when attending various meetings with an informal group of neo-liberal intellectuals, business men and politicians called Gananan Forum, due an conincidential encounter with the son of a Korean ferry company operating lines from Incheon to Tianjin. A few years after this first encounter the son tried to established some human aid company and other abstract business concepts and was unsuccessfully running for congressman in 2011. This person used the word friend, yet the author thinks it was used merely for reasons of qualifying his reputation as an international scholar.

	{{The author}} accidentially or systematically developed an approach of loss to determine true friends. Only those remaining in contact after, what the {{the author}} calls a social access black out, in situations as losing {{his|her|its}} phone or deleting all email addresses during operating system failures or the social suicide of social media identities, had potential to create long lasting friendships in the first place.

After meeting up with his friend a couple of times {{he]she|it}} realizes, "True friends means something else, because true friends are like true love. They become family!" The author thinks about the 902 facebook friends {{he]she|it}} just added to his 3rd account and realizes how profitably people are. The vast facebook empire is chaning from one position, that of being a place for people to connect and share virtual stuff with other interested people around the globe, to a place where all these friends grow up from being college students to just photos in a year book vunerable to minor marketing approaches. 

{{The author}} reckons every 3rd invoersoty commoliton he had is probably now facebook markting for Zalando or Nike or any other Berlin based startup. 

Which brings up another aspect of evolving markets:

### Tütte mit System (zum Aufreisen), Systeme ohne Tütte.

In what Dimension is a systematic approach helpful to identify the needs of customers or clients or the new model of social entity. Since we already merged producers and clients as we melted them together by the rules of the merchantile system and other social bounds, the question is one of consistency of a system, integrity.

"Paperbag with system" is meant to promote the cleverness of the provider, the bakery in that case, and uses a by the provider already favoured bag made out of paper to convince of a good eating experience. Yet, all it does is shifting the lead of attention to marketing instead of the product which is after all just a bloody sandwich from a bakery. {{The author}} thinks there is an inequality in "layering of systems". That of the organic fair trade sonscious citizen who prefers paper towards plastic, order ("mit System") over disorder, yet he unconsciously oversees even then ban was wrapt with a second layer of waxed paper. 

{{The author}} compares this "Al Natura" approach to traditional alternatives, where a sandwich is taken out of the display and put on a plate next to a voluntary tissue dispenser!

We do learn that we have to decypher our communication strategies to come to core products, which was the intention to eat a decent sandwich in this peticular case.

The questions seem to never stop.

Where is this place called alternative markets after Germany has a history of green politics, they had hippie too, and they are rather accademically thinking, yet the author can not  find a job that has anything to do with permaculture technologies. 

Google, spits out! First some products like the described paper bag with system, than regular IT jobs around Berlin and than all the institutes that teach and charge to become a permaculture designer, as if permaculture is a family based, in rare cases taught and not industrialized part of a none-excisting economy. {{The author}} himself found out about Manobu's _______ teachings and Bill ______ adaptions to permaculture just two years ago, yet it changed his view on technolog as well and would save the industry actual money if applied properly. Properly executed grassroots development saves debugging and mantainance of of outdated programs and overall costs, a wait-and-see-what-naturally-grows - in a more enclosed sense  - would make tech development comparable to harvesting fruitful and juicy code from the web fields and wineyards.

After returning to Berlin, questions pain {{the author}}. It truely is a sign to wake up from the trip. Insomnia, herting liver, without continuning the constant change of locality fatigue add to {{his|her|its}} field of emotions.

{{He]She|It}} looks at the world with diffirent eyes, realizing that hypermotivated self-enslavement by those parking in the tech startup scene, neither have found new ways of social integrity, not does anyone do anything else but reinventing the wheel. Why would one after seeing nothingness, ones and the simplest human emotions and natural greatness with people enchanted by their passions of real communication, return to fugures and numbers? After seeing people giving up financial security because they despice the customers that come to their performance space to park their Louis Vuitton carrying {{girlfriend's|boyfriend's|machinefriend's}} and some Belgian beer? City continues? // unreadable (page 51)



### Morning, grey, techno is on the way.

The author and two friends that camp in his appartment drag their bodies to his studio. As usual they miss the S-Bahn connecting to the Ring at Neukölln. 

It is 12:30 and {{the author}} wonders what might be the reason for which {{he]she|it}} is hanging out with these dudes. They have been his only connection to a vaguely self-defnied philosophy of understanding everything and the core of any situation. Their research is mostly trance induced paired with a little something for insomnia, another something waking and staying up, yet another against a depression that probably arose some time during the last regular job, and a bunch of others things for general exploration.

It is 12:45. Still {{he]she|it}} is wondering what makes them so self-assured. In a way there is probably 200000 souls like them in this city that have the same experience, but why in god's name did they choose to to stay with {{him|her|it}}? They continue preaching free choice, yet all choose the same something.

	"What role am I playing right now?"

{{The author}} stops his daily routine, at this very moment, goes deep inside hiimself and is analyzing what {{he]she|it}} is - where {{he]she|it}} is.

"I am not a subject. I is the role I am playing at any given point in time, so I is {{the author}}.
I am sitting at a Jobcenter, trying to find help to get out of programming. If this fails, I, {{the author}} will have to go to a monastray, temple or farm, start a hermittage. Abandon the city, that could not keep up with my expectations. I am a hipster, overqualified, overdressed. {{The author}} feels some uncomfort in a place he has never been before. I am a patient who is going to get help by a company/institute for utilizing human resource, yet it feels like comforting help at least for right now. {{The author}} gains comfort in simply waiting for instructions. Years of self-reliant freelance and not actual but contemplated independence have worn {{him|her|it}} tired of making decissions. {{The author}} feels like a loser, yet the people waiting along side with him share no such projections. {{The author}} relaxes .. and again tonight I has to play another role. Techno live set at Tresor. With a double Zen circle in its logo, what could one possibly expect?"

{{The author}} waits another 15 minutes gazing at those immigrants, socially disabled and kicked out of society creatures around, takes {{his|her|its}} waiting ticket, kicks it in the trash bin and head's out of this god forsaken human dump ...

### A parallel story of two and two Jazz Musicians from Paris

It is actually Hamza, Damien and Julien. {{The author}} met the partner of Damine only briefly and forgot his name, yet their stories was of constant interest and there was earlier unfullfilled arrangements to make music together that failed due to the same trance {{the author}} is talking about in this entire book. {{He|She|It}}
met after another Trans-Europe train trip Berlin-Paris-London. The first night in Paris is like a time travel to the intelligencia of the early 20th century. Philosophers, artisans, scientists sit and perform entertaining tasks at a friends luxury appartment. After billions of wine, {{the author}} had a romantic one night stand with an elderly chemist researcher from Italy. Leaving a fake number, and heading for a dinner with {{his|her|its}} friends {{he]she|it}} starts drinking again and just barely makes it to the train to London from Gare du l'est. On the train {{the author}} calls Steve, an Australian singer-song-writer, who will the following year give up on his dream to become a British singing legend. Supposingly an option in guitar music. Steve is really happy to hear {{the author}} made the journey and invites {{him|her|it}} to a concert he had coming up the very same night. What a lucky surprise. 

{{The author}} thinks to {{himself|herself|itself}}: "Nice, a cozy English pub some beers and friends. What a great conincidence." Yet, {{he]she|it}} was totally wrong. {{The author}} shrugs as he hears the venue name-Fabrics? That doesn't sound like a poet's stage? It is London's most famous techno warehouse-asking for abrief explaination for this off-focus locality, this is French band is mentioned. Just, as {{the author}} recalls this event, the S-Bahn is passing "Salon zur Wilden Renate", the residence club of the French macs. 

Getting to the club is easy. {{The author}} has an MPC 1000 and a TR-707 in alluminum cases, so also getting in is super easy after he mentioned the friends name. A regular, but not so easy to perform stunt, that due to the weight of the gear and the actual value that if the party is getting too wild, may risk further performance ability. {{He|She|It}} finds Steve in a super good mood and is draged backstage. The club is amazing, 3 floors, more than 1000 people and dark industrial techno and house from everywhere. Loads of drunk English boys and girls. It doesn't take long till the first lines of coke are thrown onto the table. {{The author}} actually has never seen this much spread out on a table ever before. It feels like the band and crew is using their lower arms to make lines. Surprisingly enough, some conversation is possible and Damien tells about his passion and Jazz education. {{The author}} does not know yet, he was actually studying together with Hamza and Julien in Paris, that {{he|she|it}} is going to meet more than one year later for the first time in Austria on a mountain cottage.

Damien and Steve are very fine people and {{the author}} wonders what is wrong at this place? Why are they here? Later on, the show embarks, Steve actually brought an electric guitar and Damien is playing a crazy Moog synthezier, rocking the house fueled with Champaign by their manager, a sleezy bold headed guy with tiny glasses from behind the stage. {{The author}} steals one or the other bottle of champaign  and jumps the stage 
{{himself|herself|itself}} every once in a while. A raging techno house party!

It's two years later, Hamza (saxophone) and Julien (trumpet) decided to travel to Berlin after they encounter {{the author}} in Steiermark close to Graz on the mountain camp. They spend a few days recording with Damien, but as {{the author}} has told them before, their mental and musical capabilities shrank down to a minimun that barely empowered his and his friend to play and record arranged songs. No improvisation, no sense. Long story short, they were pissed and hoped to find salvation in jaming with {{the author}}. Julien buys a bottle of Vodka every night and later after their departure {{the author}} has no other use for it but to make mouthwash with Blutwurz, Süßholz and Kamille.

None of these recordings ever made it to the public, yet the guys played a show with {{the author}} at OHM formerly Shift at Tresor. A place initially designed by Tresor to regain street credibility and opened on new years 2013. It was first curated by Leon, a very smart young and ambitious curator. His deals were easy, artists were allowed to propose whatever or where contacted by Leon directly to showcase between exhibition performance, and of course culminate if the given crowd allowed into a party. Within a year, the bar boss Thorsten, a very nice fellow as well, yet much longer in the business was pushing towards a more profitable booking. He pressed limits such as filling the space before a certain time, make a minimun of at least 400,00 EUR at the bar 

	Some techno math: 

	Shift/OHM is a venue of 70 people maximum capacity at the same time. Over a night the most {{the author}} ever heard of was 150/170 souls, and that is packed.

	"Underground" promoters are an enthusiastic bunch that can charge not much more than 5,00 EUR at the door for a night. Reasons therefore are an audience consisting mostly of hipsters, students and self-chosen starving artists, who see no much value is redistributing to "their own kind". Hedonists enjoy free beer more than anything!

	So a promoter can make 200,00-350,00 EUR a night that lasts from 10 PM - 6 AM. That's 8 hours of DJ and if the promoter is ready to take any sort of risk, there may be a 50 minute to 1h 30 minutes. So that's an average of 4 DJ's plus 1 or 2 musicians. 

	That makes an average of not even 50,00 EUR each act, the promoter taking none. 

	The bar consists of 3 people selling small beers for 3,00 EUR (buying: 0,50 EUR) and long drinks for 6,00 to 8,00 EUR. The drinking ability of ravers is increased with the amount of drugs taken. 20,00 are minimum to enjoy 6 hours of rave. One can easily add another 30,00 EUR on various addeables. So on a good night the bar makes a profit of 1000,00 to 2000,00 EURs profit, paying 3 people 10 EUR for 8 hours - that's 240,00 EUR personal. Now the mininum of 400,00 makes sense. Even on a bad night, where the promoters make not much more than 100,00 EUR at the door, and the acts have an empty dancefloor (or idealistically a place for performances) working at the bar is never about music! The deal is not even and the motivation is truely driven by other measures.

	{{The author}} does not recognize Laptops as a convincing tool for live performance. It is more like reading some friends facebookstream or realtime downloading samples from beatport. An introverted journey into a digital parallel existence, that is cut off the audience present. The state of mind in which a creative process is meeting an audience require physical connection between intend and immidiate Nachvollziehbarkeit and creates a collaborative enthusiasm about the thing produced. In {{the author's}} opinion a DJ has more a social and curational purpose and rarely ellaborates his skills or function to that of a performer. Marketing is often blurring the image and trys to indentify artistic creation with the persona of a DJ. Entertainer smile at the audience and provoke their reaction with gestures, cliches, jokes and a very huge stock of popular references. They present what various others created in a cheerful and well-curated manner. Entertainers are ABOUT what they are showcasing. Performers are communicating through what they produce. A live performance is the most intimite moment for a musician. Only if our general communication is shifting to a new level of recognition and realization through our very own center of perception, we are able to make a difference between the both.

### Self-marketing,

The outside view,
the jobs in the indusry,
your portfolio showing only "art", those things of pleasure, those things showing how you want to be.
It reminds {{the author}} of an advertisment professor who was doing projects with "Weisser Ring" about aid for disabled people, yet his assignments at Schol&Friends were campaigns for Lucky Strike - A convinced non-smoker!

The question is this: Where are we pushing society, when we push expectations of each other by showing off a lifestyle rather tahn an actual body of work? For the contemporary modern persona, one must be able to produce music, one must be able to draw, to blog about the latest in sound and fashion, one must not sell his artwork. 

	"Which role am I playing right now?"

{{The author}} feels like he is playing the morally untouchable preacher, white collar unfailable, yet {{he|she|it}} is being pushed there by a mixture of a no-show date and the ongoing braunloop of not able to find a job without a computer involved. {{He|She|It}} is playing the social critic, blaming the placce he is at for his own misery. Too spoiled to handle anything money related. On the right motivation {{he|she|it}} can handle anything-in a depressed moody vibe with a bit of rain and not a single bit of success, {{he|she|it}} feels like being not qualified for anything. The role {{he|she|it}} is playing, is the role {{he|she|it}} can not find. This uncertainty to be in the middle, not the center of everything, like Zahnbelag between {{his|her|its}} teeth, like cigarettes between classes. {{He|She|It}} feels sorry about cheating the system of education, figuring out and complaing about its stupidity and its discrimination. How it tries to categorize people and what they have to do in order to function for society/companies. If {{he|she|it}} would have only choosen not to be able to cheat. Was it lazyness that made {{him|her|it}} choose a new role everyday, defending it as if somebody else could swear on {{his|her|its}} mother, threating {{his|her|its}} en face (sig) with ignorance of their knowledge. {{The author}} pities {{himself|herself|itself}} for never doing a non-academic job, for {{he|she|it}} can not value the value of little work, that slowly sums up to a respectable amount. {{His|Her|Its}} expenses would have always exceeded his earnings. In a way, very respectbale for a member of a capatilist society {{he|she|it}} doesn't want to be a member of, yet emigration would mean ... the loop!

{{The author}} tries to imagine a future society, future of a a world one can hardly belief its linearity, future of a present world whose language simplified, died, or replaced by one of signs, symbols and logos of brands, cults, clubs, digital entities that are multilayered and will reveal more about function than sense.

Will there bureaucracy?
Will there be government?

Yes, but it will be privatized to many extends, and yes it will be made up of even more bureaucracy than we can imagine right now. Companies, enthusiastic individuals, national, regional law-making, localizations - the full extend of global-local, the omni-presence of many gods in a flat hierachy, 

or the individual will determine his sphere of influence. People will be bound, tied to there immidiate "sphere of gods", sets of rules. For example, {{the author}} is trying once again to take a train from Berlin to Augsburg.  {{The author's}} Deutsche Bahn discount card expired. {{He|She|It}} failed to pay the anual subscription fee on time. A new card is obsolete, yet existent bound to the rules of the contract. The regulation is that {{he|she|it}} pays fulls price and on future display of the renewed card once it is eventually issued, the traveller receives the discount minus a 15,00 EUR fee. To avoid this not so easy to comprehend set of rules a friend suggested to book a ticket via LTUR, an external travel agaency, where unreserved seats are sold low-budget and last-minute. Yet, those tickets a legally bound to online tickets and {{the author}} printing them on {{him|her|its}} own. What happens: {{The author}} arrives in a hurry at Berlin main station, wishing to fullfill two of the requirements. 

A: to find a place for printing the ticket
B: get to the right train in time (tickets are bound to booked trains only)

{{The author}} trusting  {{his|her|its}} personal set of experience and eventually false hopes from previous journeys fails in both tasks on the agenda - 
complete failure!

Compete failure!
Asking for a printing option is replied by a harsh reminder that one is supposed to have a printer at home at first response. Secondly, after insisting on an advice if there is anybody else in the train station to solve this task, in exchange of a small or large fee self-speaking, is replied by "we are not a place to know this", and thirdly referring {{the author}} to track #2 to the train to Munich asking for the train to Augsburg. {{The author}} improvises after {{he|she|it}} realized time is running short and the bespoken train to Munich is about to depart only 5 minutes delayed. A tourist information center is consulted about the service of providing a print out, yet rejects {{the author}} referring to their rules of service to not let clients access computers by the employers, which to some surprise has not been the initial request whatsoever. On the question if there is another option anywhere in reach of time and space, {{the author}} is referred to a hotel next to the station closer to the German parliament than a terrorist snipper would ever get. The options are narrowing down!

{{The author}} can not miss the train and take the next one, as before said, LTUR tickets are bound to certain specific trains. {{He|She|It}} decides to give it a try and rushes to the train on track #2 no matter what!

The train departs 10 minutes past schedule.

{{The author}} ends up paying again full price, yet the train keeper tried to scan the online ticket of {{the author's}} laptop screen. There the train keeper (female) realizes that {{the author}} should have been inanother train upstairs on another track.

	{{The author}} concludes: 

	"To many gods to make single adjustments, if one does not constantly adjust the final goal or destination depending on the course of {{his|her|its}} own path. Yet, if {{he|she|it}} fails to trust the omen that {{his|her|its}} regular gods have to offer, even a traditional concept such as intercity travel can become an unstable ride."

{{The author}} meditates over an organic instant Deutsche Bahn Flammkuchen Elsaßer Art and a portion of instant Chilli con Carne, realizing its been the most common situation an alian from outer space could experience and imagining how this situation would require a 4 kid family of non-German-speaking origin weeks of mental training to withhold complete madness or self-diffusation.

{{The author}} continued to write about {{his|her|its}} experience a couple of days after {{he|she|it}} returned from Munich. The original intend was to return straight after the gig at City Club, but plans are to be taken light headed after 6 AM gigs anyhow. {{He|She|It}} found out later that the actual second ticket and respectivly fourth ticket sold to {{the author}} on the way back were regular fullprice tickets, not even liabil for partial discount at all.

{{The author}} mubles a prayer to all gods:

"Love Complex systems - love simplified approaches!
Must love irony, must love omni-present diversity and infinite levels of problems and their solutions.
Must love the meaning of loving everything, since even that is a self-centered directive.
{{The author}} can love the eternal imperfection of the world, 
{{the author}} can love the illusion to be capabile to systemize it, 
{{the author}} can love higher beings for keeping it all together,
{{the author}} can love complex explainations why all of this is so complex 
and {{the author}} could also love one another."

You don't want to live my life, yet again: You live the same."


### (Another) Breakdown

When {{the author}} themes a peticular problem into {{his|her|its}} consciousness, it is real, therefore most relevant in its existence.

Dear beloved reader, you have to understand that {{the author}} at this very moment is very uncertain about a huge Raggae soundsystem that Kevin aka The Bug is having delivered to the studio on Wednesday morning not having a slight idea about the actual measures of the beast. "It is 5 o'clock in the morning. I haven't slept enough, my brain is like a hyperactive ninja, who's in everybodies mind, but nowhere to be seen. Just now I was sitting in bed talking to mylsef, tired of multiple solutions close to tears and transforming it into written words."

The written not computeized word is a relief. It challenges progress, it disrespects stress, even if one writes fast, it is merely behind {{the author's}} thought. The digital revolution is apparently the first time that we collectively are trying to world-in-existence (sic) what can be written, published and read even before the concept is formed in ones mind. Interfaces are made for direct response. We get to read mind status updates from people that never dared to speak their mind on a hourly rate. Almost like quantums our thoughts wandered/will wander in the continuity/spot/loop of time. Everything is said and heard. Our world's explaination drives people into absurd states of consciousness. 

This is why {{the author}} is writing this book. A trip book! A trip we did not decide to take. It has been always our parents generations trip. Throwing acid and writing books was posthumly (lat. past ones life) regarded the thing todo for the intectual avant garde of the hippies, pre or post. Their aim to question our mindset, constantly questioning is driving us, if we want or not. The liberation of complexity and unreasonability invisibility of war, that we can not tell major wrong doings, and blame it only on our confusion - ALL THESE MAKE OUR WORLD, one that can not judge in cross (im großen ganzen).

{{The author}} chose a conservative position, something very very undercomplex to return to a state of balance. The visions, the hopes of free people's minds drive humanity mad. On this planet we populate, we die in greater amounts than ever, we estinguish other populations and our selves, yet the only thing we put our focus on is the Zen timer app in our iphone, developed by a generation of 20 year old technocrates and trans-humanists in the metropolies of our world. {{The author}} also notices that Yom Ki-Pur was ones building a regime of terror based on the judgement of unspoiled childrens minds. The Red Khmer executed the youngsters judgement on spot in the hope of forming a true socialist society. 

We have to trust our children, that is the exchange between the generations, yet our children will make every one of us unemployed by developing software that generates money out of keeping people occupied witht he cycle of thought, contribution and reconsumption mentioned earlier in this chapter, {{the author}} would like to title: "Night of the mad".

Next to the authors bed, three books have found their way into the narative: Gravities Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon, a sureal mindfuck about the psychodelic experience of German V2 bombardments of London - living regular lifes just infront of an execution squad with their fingers pulling the trigger any time. Instant death by chance is much more likely than being hit by a lightning, yet even without a thunerstorm accompanying the coming doom. A novum of human terror that pushed our consciousness most definitely further into remaining and feeling comfortable in a single "frame" of time - a new nowness (sic) or timelessness. Yet, the book is surprisingly optimistic. There is no food and lots of rats, but it describes how for a whole generation to come decissions are already made. Whom to bed with, what's the weather tomorrow, because if it is rainy, 





	Interlude:
	{{The author}} does not want the {{girl|boy|machine}} that wants {{the author}} to be unhappy, yet {{he|she|it}} does not love {{her|him|it}}. There were much more reasons to move to {{her|his|its}} city and there is so many things and people met, that ending the affair will eventually cut ties to a new univers. The {{girl|boy|machine}} is too much in love to understand {{the author's}} rationality and lust of life. {{The author}} may never see Vienna ever again, yet {{he|she|it}} learned too much loving is blindness and language never enough to tell the heart. {{The author}} realizes, that writing is putting the self into the text, and from there the wormhole is closed forever. There is no return from the text.
